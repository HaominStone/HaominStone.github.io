=====
In this work, we present an information propagation game on a network where the information is originated from a sponsor and the sponsor is willing to pay a fixed total budget to the nodes who propagate the information. The goal is to design a mechanism to share the budget such that all nodes are incentivized to propagate the information to all their neighbours. We propose a family of mechanisms to achieve the goal. The mechanisms incentivize all nodes to propagate the information to their neighbours even though the total reward shared among them is fixed. We also consider the cases whether the budget has to be completely shared. Our solution can be applied for advertising via social networks with limited budgets.
